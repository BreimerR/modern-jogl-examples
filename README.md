Note: at the moment there is ~~a gradle,~~ a general refreshing and kotlin implementation in progress, it'll be back to normal asap (the most tedious work is to complete chapter 12, it's quite long actually)

====================

<img src="./src/main/resources/screenshots/jogl.png" height="250px"> 

Examples ported in JOGL from the tutorials "Learning Modern 3D Graphic Programming" by J.L.McKesson, (original bitbucket [repository](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/overview)).

The original website (http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut) is down because probably the domain [expired](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/issues/127/arcsynthesisorg-web-site). Pavel Rojtberg is continuing the manteinance of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/paroj/gltut). 

He is also supporting the html form of the documentation [here](https://paroj.github.io/gltut/), I strongly suggest you to read and refer it during the learning of each tutorial sample.

You can find the examples in java under [`src/main/java`](https://github.com/java-opengl-labs/modern-jogl-examples/tree/master/src/main/java/main) and the corresponding in kotlin under [`src/main/kotlin`](https://github.com/java-opengl-labs/modern-jogl-examples/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/main)
