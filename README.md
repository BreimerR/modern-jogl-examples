modern-jogl-examples
====================

Examples ported in JOGL from the book "Learning Modern 3D Graphic Programming" by J.L.McKesson

To run the examples, just follow these simple steps:

- clone the project

- download the dependencies from http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z

- create a Library called "JOGL"

- import it and point it to the jogamp-all-platforms\jar\gluegen-rt.jar and jogamp-all-platforms\jar\jogl.jar



In this project there are the original Jglm and the java unofficial opengl SDK. At the end of 2012 I decided to make them as separated projects, in order to make things clear and hope that they could grow their own. But you don't need them, the original ones work out of the box.
