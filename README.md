modern-jogl-examples
====================

Examples ported in JOGL from the book "Learning Modern 3D Graphic Programming" by J.L.McKesson

You can find the pdf in the root of the project (you can see it also above), I strongly suggest you to read it and try to write the exercises in your own.

To run the examples, just follow these simple steps:

- clone the project

- download the dependencies from http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z

- create a Library called "JOGL"

- import it and point it to the jogamp-all-platforms\jar\gluegen-rt.jar and jogamp-all-platforms\jar\jogl.jar

Remember to clean & build after cloning it!


In this project there are the original Jglm and the java unofficial opengl SDK. At the end of 2012 I decided to make them as separated projects, in order to make things clear and hope that they could grow their own. But you don't need them, the original ones work out of the box.



Ps: in the last jogl builds GL3 has been moved, so in the meanwhile I upgrade all my projects, you have to change it by yourself  :grimacing:

Pps: upgrading in progress.. be patient  :pray:
