modern-jogl-examples
====================

Examples ported in JOGL from the book "Learning Modern 3D Graphic Programming" by J.L.McKesson

To run the examples, just follow these simple steps:

- clone the project

- download the dependencies from http://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z

- create a Library called "JOGL"

- import it and point it to the jogamp-all-platforms\jar\gluegen-rt.jar and jogamp-all-platforms\jar\jogl.jar
