Examples ported in JOGL from the tutorials "Learning Modern 3D Graphic Programming" by J.L.McKesson, (original bitbucket [repository](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/overview)).

The original website (http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut) is down because probably the domain [expired](https://bitbucket.org/alfonse/gltut/issues/127/arcsynthesisorg-web-site). Pavel Rojtberg is continuing the manteinance of the tutorial [here](https://github.com/paroj/gltut). 

He is also supporting the html form of the documentation [here](https://paroj.github.io/gltut/), I strongly suggest you to read and refer it during the learning of each tutorial sample.

Steps:

- add jars under `\lib`
- remove the tutorials with errors in order to "clean & build", necessary step to find the shaders

In case you may see some error in the tutorials that should be running (see list below), just clone the original project (look on my repos or on [java-graphic](https://github.com/java-graphics)) and add it.

Status, everything where not specified, it means it is ported, updated - because I am also rewriting the samples using the jogl high performance native toolkit [newt](http://jogamp.org/jogl/doc/NEWT-Overview.html) - and working:

- Chapter 1, Hello Triangle
- Chapter 2, Playing with Colors
- Chapter 3, Moving Triangle
- Chapter 4, Objects at Rest
- Chapter 5, Objects at Depth
- Chapter 6, Objects in Motion
- Chapter 7, World in Motion
- Chapter 8, Getting Oriented
- Chapter 9, Lights On
- Chapter 10, Plane Lights
- Chapter 11, Shinies
- Chapter 12, Dynamic Lights, to complete
- Chapter 13, Lies and Impostors, 
- Chapter 14, Textures are not Pictures, in progress
- Chapter 15, Many Images, to update
- Chapter 16, Gamma and Textures, to update
- Chapter 17, Spotlight on Textures, to update
